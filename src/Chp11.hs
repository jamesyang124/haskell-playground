-- Skip Chp10 - Functionally Solving Problems

Many times the box analogy is used to help you get some intuition for how functors work, and later, we'll probably use the same analogy for applicative functors and monads.

A more correct term for what a functor is would be "computational context". The context might be that the computation can have a value or it might have failed (Maybe and Either a) or that there might be more values (lists), stuff like that.
